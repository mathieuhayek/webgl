Simple-WebGL-Project
====================

Simple WebGL project just to both refresh some basic OpenGL skills and experiment with WebGL. All the project does is randomly generate voxels in a 30 x 30 x 30 space.

## Controls
User can move in world space with the following controls:
* **'a'** Moves the camera *left*
* **'d'** Moves the camera *right*
* **'w'** Moves the camera *forward*
* **'s'** Moves the camera *backwards*
* **'q'** Moves the camera *up*
* **'e'** Moves the camera *down*

User can manipulate the voxel cube rotation with the following controls:
* **Left and Right Arrows** Accelerates the cubes rotation on the *y axis*
* **Up and Down Arrows** Accelerates the cubes rotation on the *x axis*
